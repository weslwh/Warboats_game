### Extending the Game

  To extend the game, a developer could use the Warboats code as a base for adding more features to the game. One example would be implementing a turn timer, so that the player has a limited amount of time to choose which position to guess. To do this, a timer could be implemented in the main.py file inside the loop that runs the game. A timer could be added so that when it expires, the player's turn ends and the computer guesses again.

  Another way to extend the game would be to add special abilites for the player to choose from. These abilities could be related to the types of ships in the warbaots game (i.e. torpedo attack, radar scan etc), but as expressed in the code would just be patterns of coordinates that would be guessed as one move.

  To install the game, simple clone the Warboats repository. To play them game, the Pygame library is required. Since the game is written in Python, no compilation is requred on behalf of the user, simply run 'main.py' and a window will appear for the game.

**How to play**:
  Warboats is a game consisting of two players: You and the computer. The game takes place on a 10 by 10 grid board, where the player can click on any of those grid spaces. At the start of the game you must place a set of ships onto the board, where the location of the ships will be hidden from the computer. The computer will do the same, and your goal is to find where all the computers ships are hidden.
  
  The game is turn-based, so after the player guesses a space by clicking on a grid space, the game will let the computer guess. After that, the player gets to guess again. This repeats until either sides have no remaining ships left. The side that still has their remaining ships wins. 

  The game is to be played using

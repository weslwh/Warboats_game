### How to install:
  To install the game, simply clone the Warboats repository to the desired location on your system. No compilation of source code is required on behalf of the user since Warboats is written in Python. Note that the Pygame library is a dependency of the Warboats application so it will need to be installed on the user's system for Warboats to function properly.

### Controls of the Game:
  Use the mouse cursor and click on spaces in your grid to place your ships. Click on spaces of the computers board to guess where the computer's ships are. Clicking on the close button for the window exits the game.

### How to play:
  Warboats is a game played between the user and the computer. The game takes place on two 10 by 10 grid boards. The grids at the bottom and top of the application window are the player's and computer's boards respectively. Players will take turns guessing positions on their opponent's board. During the 'placing' phase at the start of the game, you must place you set of ships by clicking on the desired positions on your board. The computer will do the same for its ships and respective board. When both players have placed their ships, the 'placing' phase is over and the battle begins.
  
  The game is turn-based and the player is allowed to have the first guess. To guess a position on the computer's board, click on the part of the grid that you think a computer's ship may be, the guessed position is then recoloured red for 'hit' or blue for 'miss'. After the player guesses, the computer will guess against the player, then it is the player's turn again, and so on. Players will continue to take turns guessing against each other until either the player or computer have sunk all of their opponent's ships. The side that succeeds in sinking all of their opponent's ships wins the game. Once the game has ended, a message is displayed stating the winner.
